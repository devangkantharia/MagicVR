\section{Outlook}

The implemented animation framework makes it easy to implement further animation types and more complex movements while they stay very control- and adjustable. There are multiple further ways how and where this animation framework could be applied e.g. animating not only Vectors but also materials, colors, transparency etc.\\

Also because of the lack of time there was no opportunity to implement a better user guidance. Our idea would have been to implement a little fairy which gives hints about interaction possibilities and demonstrates according gestures by flying them in front of the user.
